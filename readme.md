# MSTU 5003 Design Document

The Website's name is Kinder Spanish. It is an interactive program that helps teachers and parents teach
Spanish to children using a dynamic structure designed by me using a multimodal approach. I started each lesson with a video of a cartoon with two characters: A dog and a cat. The two characters talk to each other in English and Spanish while doing actions that relates to real life situations. The videos are short in length and each section of the lesson, including the assessment are based on a micro-learning strategy. While designing the instructional structure of the website and the most effective way for children to learn and retain information, I incorporated John Sweller's Cognitive load theory. During the lesson, the process of learning is broken down into small sections. Each section is very specific as to what is required to learned. This allows for a reduction of Extraneous cognitive load which is sometimes unnecessary. Every section in the lesson is interrelated and most importantly is designed to create relationships with every day behaviors as to maximize Germane cognitive load, which will ultimately construct schemas.

### User Stories

Her income is $150,000 and uses internet at work and 50% at home to read the news and do online shopping. She spends most of her time working and only has the weekends to dedicate time to review school work with her kids. She is of hispanic decent and is fluent in Spanish. She would like her kids to learn Spanish as a second language. She is frustrated that the school her children attend does not have a Spanish language program and that their kids are missing out. She was thinking of enrolling them in Spanish classes on Saturdays but that is the time she spends with them. She would like a program that she can supervise and work with her children so that they learn together.

His annual income is $50,000 and uses internet 100% of the time at home to read educational newsletters and get updates for his favorite sport teams. he would like to use web-based programs for his students at school. Frank is fluent in Spanish and his school is planning to develop a bilingual program for the kindergarten class. He has been doing a lot of research on different Spanish programs but is looking specifically for a web-based interactive program that he can get more information on learning Spanish and to track the progress of each of his students.


## Strategy

### Site Objectives:
*What do we want to get out of the site?*
I want to provide users with a interactive web-based tool to teach Spanish to Kindergarten level students, help them assess what the students know and what they have accomplished after using the tool. I am creating this tool because I feel there is a need for an easy to use website that can guide parents and educators teaching Spanish to kindergarten students.

### Success Metrics
*Outline how you will check that the goals for your site have been met*
At the kindergarten level there is a specific grammar structure and vocabulary that one should know. I will help the teacher/parent pre asses those objectives and then by the end of the lesson they will be provided with a final assessment. They will be given feedback on their weak areas and will be prompted to review that area of concern. After they complete a satisfactory level, they will be prompted to make a choice whether they are satisfied with the learning experience or not, and additional space if they want to write feedback.

Make sure your program does something to measure the consider assessments as a part of your program. Here are a couple.

* Pre assessments
* Formative assessments


## Scope
Functional and Content Specifications
The website will have a menu with links to other pages and information on the menu title as requested by the user. There is a home bottom which will always direct the user to the main page. There is "research" which will provide insight and information as to why is important to learn a second language at a young age and the specific benefits of learning Spanish. There is a "how this works" tab, which will explain the program to the user and how the learning is assessed. In the "Get Started" tab, the user will be able to start the pre assessment and then be directed to the concepts he/she will need to learn. After the pre assessment, the users will enter the lessons page where all the important concepts, grammar and vocabulary is to be learn. The lessons page will have multimodal learning. In the "From the beginning" tab, the user will not start with pre assessment. Instead, he/she will start with beginner's concepts, grammar and vocabulary. Basically they will start at the lessons page. At the beginning of every step of the process , the user will be asked to create an account so that the program can keep track of the users and their progress. The data will me managed by the content management system (CMS). There is a "Tips" tab, where users can find techniques and information to make the sessions with children more interesting. This tab will serve as a substitution for FAQs content on various websites. There is a "Contact us" tab, with information on the developer.  

## Structure
Interaction design and information architecture
The interaction design of the website will allow the user to navigate easily throughout the main areas of interest, starting with the why I should even bother to spend time learning Spanish or "research" tab. If the user is ready to start, he/she will take the pre assessment or skip that and start from the beginning at the "From the Beginning" tab. They will be asked to create a username and password to keep track of the progress. They will follow the instructions and lessons of the "Lessons" page where they will have fun while learning. After each mini lessons, they will take a quick assessment and move on to the next mini lesson. At the end of the lessons, the users will take a final exam where feedback will be given and a certificate will be issued. If the system determines there is weakness in certain area, the user will be redirected to that specific mini lesson.
The information architecture is organized into 4 nodes of organizing the information. 3 nodes have the simple one page structure of information: Research, Tips, and Contact us. The 4th node, which I call the educational node, is a group that contains the get started information and the from the beginning information and lessons. The educational node uses an organic structure where the user can choose to follow the sequence of lessons or could skip lessons as he/she chooses. The users will built upon previous knowledge and encourage a feeling of free-form exploration.

## Skeleton
Interface, navigation, information design

The interface is very attractive and most users that use the internet are familiar with it. The Educational node will have radio buttons to allow the user to answer the multiple choice assessments. When the user is prompted to create a username, he/she will also have Text fields where data will be entered. Same text fields will be available if user want to write feedback on the website.

The website has a Global navigation design to allow users to get out of their current position and to make it easier to understand. In the Educational node, the website uses local navigation as well to let the user know where they are in terms of the mini lessons and progress overall.

The information design of the website is conveniently labeled with specific fonts and icons for each node. Each node will have its own background color as to help the user identify where he/she is located on the website.
